<h1> Above is the <strong>aggregate demand and aggregate supply graph<strong> </h1>
  <p> This curve illustrates the real GDP on the x axis, and the price level on the y. <p>
  <p> The red dot in the middle symbolizes market equilibrium (supply = demand) <p>
<h2> Short run aggregate supply (downward sloping line) </h2>
<h3> Things that shift SRAS right </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>decreases in cost of raw materials (can produce more for the same price</li>
    <li>Increase in capital (more of a product be produced at once)</li>
    <li>Decrease in worker wages (cheaper labor = more people working)</li>
  </ul>
<h4> Things that shift SRAS left </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Any increase in resource cost shifts SRAS left (decreases)</li>
    <li>When firms expect costs of production to go up, they decrease supply</li>
    <li>Increase in nominal wages -> less workers -> less supply</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What a right shift of SRAS looks like:</h3>

  <p>Increased real GDP at equilibrium, higher price level</p>

<h3>What a right shift of AD looks like:</h3>

<p>Increased real GDP at equilibrium, but decreased price level</p>
